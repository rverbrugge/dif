STRUCTURE
=========

A Unix DIF installation consists of three parts:
     1) The "dif" package
     2) The "data" package
     3) The "htdocs" package

The dif package is the core application. You can put this application 
anywhere on the server. Typically the package is installed per site
and is located in the parent direcotry of the web root.

The data package contains all site specific settings, loggings and secured 
plugin data. 

The htdocs package is the root of the website with site specific plugins.
This package contains plugin php files, images, javascript etc.

A typical directory structure looks like this:

/var/www/site/dif					# the untared DIF core package
/var/www/site/data				# the data package
/var/www/site/htdocs			# the web package which is the web root of the site

Note:
If you do not have access to the parent directory of the web root, you can place all the components in the web root itself.

INSTALLING DIF
==============

1 Get the DIF installation package.

2 Copy the archives to the web root of your server.
  (Debian default is /var/www/, SuSE default is /srv/www/)

3 Unpack the archives:
  $ tar -xzf dif-<version>.tar.gz

4 If you are installing dif into de web root (where index.php must be) you can skip this step.
	Rename the htdocs directory to fit your needs and make sure it
  is accessible by your webserver (for example by creating a virtual
  host). For example you rename the directory to webroot:
  $ mv htdocs webroot

5 Set permissions (as root): There are at least two options.
  These steps will make four directories writable for the webserver:
  - dif
  - data
  - htdocs

	Run these commands as root in the /var/www/site/ directory:
	# chgrp -R <wwwserver> *
	# chmod -R g+rw *

	... where <wwwserver> is the name of the group your webserver
	is running as

6 Check htdocs/index.php and verify that the constant DIF_ROOT is
	pointing to the location where you placed the dif directory.
  (See above: "structure")

7 In your browser, visit
  http://[your.site.name]/admin/
  with the username "system" and password "manager".

8 Follow the instructions in the install tool

That's it :-)
